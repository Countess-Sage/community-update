Hello there! You wanna add support for a mod without editing the content file into a 9k line file? Well you've come to the right place.

- To start create a new .json file it the folder labeled "data"
- Name it as the mod you're adding compatibility with 
	ex: 'Visit Mount Valpius.json' is for compatibility with the mod of the same name
- In the newly created file copy the following:
	{
		"Changes": [
			
		]
	}

- Add the calls that content patcher needs to handle:
	ex:

	{
		"Action": "EditImage",
		"Target": "mod.uniqueID",	//This is where you should put the mods ID. You can find it in their manifest file.
		"FromFile": "assets/seeds/{{Seed Packet Variant}}/lookieatme.png",	//No, don't actually put 'lookieatme.jpg', use the name of the spritesheet you're adding.
		"FromArea": {
			"X": 0,
			"Y": 0,
			"Width": 16,
			"Height": 16
		},
		"ToArea": {
			"X": 0,
			"Y": 0,
			"Width": 16,
			"Height": 16
		},
		"Priority": "Late",
		"When": {					//
			"= Disable Entire Mod": "false",	//I won't go into detail here.
			"Seed Sprites": "Enabled",		//It's simply for the mod menu config
			"(P) Grains Overhull": "true"		//
		}
	},

- After you've gotten all the calls listed you'll wanna save it and go to the content file aptly named "content.json"
- All you have to do here is go to the end of the file and add the following
	{
		"Action": "Include",
		"FromFile": "Data/weeeeeeee.json"		//Again, don't use 'weeeeeeee.json', use your file name that you just created
	},

- Just make sure it looks like this:
				{
					//Other compatabilities
				},
				{
					"Action": "Include",
					"FromFile": "Data/weeeeeeee.json"	//Do NOT use 'weeeeeeee.json'
				}
			}
		]
	}

- Congrats! Now save the file and test it in your game.
